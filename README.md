## Hello, I'm Lucas Alves
## Student of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

I like to venture out to solve complex challenges that bring positive points to people and add value to the business. For this reason, I chose the Data Science area as a professional career, I believe in the power of data to solve complex problems.

In this repository you will find data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. It is still under construction, so I will be adding new projects and also detailing those that have already been done.

I learned a lot and I am still learning more every day with all the projects I venture and people I know.

## Projects

### [Predictive Maintenance](https://github.com/luucasalvesro/Predictive-Maintenance)
  A machine learning model for estimating remaining useful life of turbines for predictive maintenance. In this project, I created a machine learning model capable of estimating the remaining useful life and also its percentage of failure in 20 days. With this estimation, it is possible to avoid possible accidents due to lack of maintenance, as well as developing a smart maintenance schedule.

### [Forecasting Sales for Rosmmann Store](https://github.com/luucasalvesro/Rossmann-Store-Sales)
  An implementation of a machine learning model to forecast sales at Rossmann stores. The goal of this project is to predict the number of sales of 1115 Rossmann stores for a period of six weeks.
